## ABOUT ME
Hi! My name is Anu, and I am a first-year Master of Science student in Epidemiology at Mailman. Aside from public health, I am particularly interested in developing strong technical skills in various programming languages, and that is why I am taking P8105 this semester. Welcome to my website! Check out my resume to learn more about my background, or reach out via the links in the navigation!
